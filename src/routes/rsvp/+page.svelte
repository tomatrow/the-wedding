		<h2>A Culinary Explanation:</h2>
		<p>
			In true camping fashion, we plan to cook stew in two giant cauldrons over campfires. Because we will use two pots,
			we can cook two kinds of stew. However, if most of you choose one kind over the other, we may decide not to cook
			the less popular option.
		</p>
		<p>
			Both kinds will be free of the following components: eggs, dairy, gluten, corn, soy, nuts, and pork. If you have a
			dietary restriction that is not on this list, please let us know, and we will try to accommodate you.
