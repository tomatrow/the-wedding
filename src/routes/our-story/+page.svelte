	<h1>Our Story</h1>
	
	<p>
		Once upon a time, 1994 to be exact, there were two small children, Catherine and AJ, whose parents decided to begin attending a new church called Calvary Chapel Vista. Catherine and AJ grew up aware of each other’s existence but not friends…yet. Eventually, AJ reached the age of Jr. High, as one does, and developed a friendship with one of Catherine’s siblings (who was much more interesting than Catherine herself). That gateway sibling opened the door to the rest of the family—literally. And as AJ came to visit more often, he became a regular family friend until one day, he didn’t leave. He extended his stay for quite some time, having nowhere else to go, and consequently discovered that Catherine was interesting after all.

		AJ became enchanted with the beautiful maiden that he had come to know and sought advice on how he might court her favor. Alas, the advice that he followed bade him linger in her presence without any explanation, waiting for something to happen (much to her perplexity). Dear reader, if ever you find your own beautiful maiden, please proclaim your intentions rather than leave your fate to chance.

		Fortunately, something did happen, and Catherine informed AJ of her growing affection, after which AJ admitted he felt the same. Over the next six years, AJ introduced Catherine to a world of adventures that she never would have tried on her own, like driving to San Fransisco or intentionally talking to actual people who weren’t her family. During a trip to Yosemite, AJ took Catherine to The Faithful Couple, two trees that grew so close together that their bases fused. Here, he proposed that they make their arrangement more permanent. And so, on May 18, 2024, they will return to the forest to establish a marriage covenant and begin a new adventure that will never end.
