		<h2>Helpful tips:</h2>
		<p>
			This is a fancy occasion, so you may wear formal clothes in shades of green, purple, and brown. Remember, however,
			that you will be outside, so sturdy shoes, sunscreen, and insect repellent may be helpful.
		</p>
		<p>
			Children are welcome to attend; please submit an RSVP for them too. We will provide coloring pages for their entertainment.

		<h2>Important rules:</h2>
		<p>
			Sensory stimuli easily overstimulate me (Catherine). I must be very careful to limit my sensory exposure to ensure
			that I am able to remain calm and engaged the entire day. Because of this, I am not allowing any touching; you may
			not hug me, shake my hand, pat my shoulder, or any other form of touch. I would appreciate your spoken or gestured
			greetings instead. (AJ has no such need, of course; you may greet him in your preferred manner.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Clapping, cheering, or any other loud form of celebration is also banned for this day. You will receive a ribbon
			wand that you may wave in the air as an alternative.
