If you are bringing a trailer, please check that box and note that the maximum allowed trailer length is <strong>24ft</strong>. Are you willing to share a campsite with other guests? If so, what size is your tent?</p>
		<p>If you want to extend your stay, contact us, and we may be able to add additional days to your campsite.</p>
